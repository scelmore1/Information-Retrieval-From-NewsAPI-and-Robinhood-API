    "######  &emsp; The following python scripts were developed by me to help separate the different aspects of this project.  I have included comments in the files themselves to help explain what is happening within the code but I will go through an overview of the functionality here to explain what needs to happen before any document retrieval can be done.  \n",
    "######  &emsp;The first file \"Robinhood API.py\" is how I connect to the Robinhood API and download a list of stocks that can be used as queries for the purpose of this project.  Originally I wanted to use the collection of stocks that I own on Robinhood as the stocks to query, but the market has gone crazy due to the COVID situation which caused me to liquidate my portfolio.  So, instead of using the API to get the stocks that I own, I will use it to query the top moving (up or down) stocks of the day.  For the purpose of this assingment, I decided to get two days of the top movers, resulting in 32 total stocks.  I had hoped since they are the top moving stocks, there will be documents associated with them, but as I will touch on, this was optimistic.  The python file outputs a .json file containing the stock ticker and company name as strings for all 32 stocks.  This code is commented out because the file has already been generated at 'stock_portfolio.json'.\n",
    "###### &emsp; The second file \"News API.py\" is code for accessing the News API.  This is a free API that aggregates news sources and returns a list of all url's of articles contained in the API request.  The request can be specified to only return articles of a certain category, so for this project I decided to only return articles related to 'business' and 'technology'. I also limited the articles returned to be created in the last 3 weeks.  This created a list of 2074 articles.  I also used a python library called 'newspaper' to handle the web scraping of the url's for me.  The code from this file ultimately outputs a .json file with article urls and the text of their contents.  The code is commented out here because the files have already been read and downloaded to the file 'newsapi_articles.json'.\n",
    "###### &emsp; The third file \"Inverted Index Creation.py\" is where I create the inverted index using the text from the articles.  I utilize a python library 'nltk' to handle the stop words and provide a Porter Stemmer.  The inverted index takes advantage of pointers to decrease the size of the data structure.  There is an 'inverted index' dictionary with the stemmed terms as keys, and the document python id's (lookup locations) as the values.  The 'pointer index' is how the inverted index finds which articles the terms actually belong to, by using the document python id.  In addition to creating an inverted index of the document terms, I also used the stemmer to update the query terms.  This code also handles creation of the TFxIDF matrix by doing the calculation when iterating over the inverted index.  First it calculates the IDF of each term by looking at how often the term is used in all the documents contained in the matrix.  Next, it calculates TFxIDF by multiplying the IDF with the term counts.  This outputs a new dictionary with term strings as keys, and TFxIDF values.  The outputted .json files are the TFxIDF dictionary and the stemmed query terms dictionary. This code is commented out because the files have already been generated at 'article_tf_idf.json' and 'query_terms.json'.\n",
    "###### &emsp; The fourth file \"Read Cranfield Collection.py\" is code for reading in the Cranfield Test Collection.  The text files from which to read from have different methods of separating document, document ID, query and query ID so must be handled in a different manner.  This collection also includes data on which documents are relevant to which query so that is also downloaded and handled.  Using a similar method to the above file, I created an inverted index using the terms contained within the documents, and created a separate dictionary for the queries and the relevancy results.  This file ultimately outputs .json files of the tf*idf dictionary, the query terms, and the relevance results. This code is commented out because the files have already been generated at '/cran.tar/crabfield_document_tf_idf.json', '/cran.tar/query_terms.json' and '/cran.tar/cranfield_query_rel.json'."

    "######  &emsp; The last file \"Final Project Functions.py\" is where I put the functions I need to load the documents, create dataframes, expand the queries, and get results from the queries themselves.  The functions are designed to apply to both the Cranfield dataset as well as my own, but with the exception of the query results.  The query result function needs to be different, because for the Cranfield dataset, I know the relevance results.  My own dataset needs human input to tell it which documents are relevant and which aren't.  I will explain more about the functions as I call them in the script below."

    "###### &emsp; Unfortunately local analysis doesn't do that much better, with only a handful of different top 3 articles for each of the stocks. It seems that the issue is with the corpus of news articles and not the algorithm itself.  Many stocks don't have one article that mentions them by name, which is surprising for a group of stocks that either went up or down the most in a trading day!  I think online article writers will always tend to write about stocks the general public knows regardless of if they were one of the most volatile stocks on that day.  I'm not surprised that queries for Oracle, United, JP Morgan, etc.. did well but queries for stocks like COTY, Ameriprise, Ventas, etc.. did poorly.  I think if I did this project again with the old stocks from my portfolio, which was mainly 'blue chip' well-known stocks; it would perform better.  However, I am pleased with how I managed to combine all the moving parts to make a functional algorithm that lets users know the best articles related to the stocks from their Robinhood portfolios.
